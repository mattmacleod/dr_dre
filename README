= dr_dre - diagnose Double Render Errors in Rails apps

dr_dre intercepts calls to render and redirect in ActionController and, if it 
detects multiple calls to render or redirect (triggering a DoubleRenderError),
will drop a couple of lines into the output log identifying where the redirect
or render calls were made from.
